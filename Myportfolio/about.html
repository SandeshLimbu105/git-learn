    <h1>Hi, Iâ€™m <span class="highlight">Sandesh Limbu</span></h1>
    <p>
      A passionate and determined learner in the world of full-stack development.<br />
      Iâ€™m currently building my skills in <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</strong>, and exploring both frontend and backend development.<br />
      I also have a basic understanding of <strong>C, C++, Java</strong>, and databases like <strong>MongoDB</strong> and <strong>MySQL</strong>.<br />
      What I lack in experience, I make up for with enthusiasm, curiosity, and a strong desire to grow.<br />
      I believe in learning by doing â€” and Iâ€™m excited to build, break, and improve with every line of code.
